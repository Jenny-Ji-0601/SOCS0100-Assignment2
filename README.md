# SOCS0100-Assignment2


# Project Overview
This project applies automated data collection techniques and interactive visualisations to analyse street-level crime patterns in London. Using the UK Police API and OpenStreetMap (OSM), the project collects, processes crime data, and presents the results through an interactive R Shiny dashboard.

This project has social science significance by examining how crime is unevenly distributed across space, time, and crime categories in London. By integrating crime data with police station locations, it provides insight into spatial inequality in urban safety and the distribution of policing resources. The interactive visualisations further support social science analysis by making complex crime patterns accessible and interpretable.


# Project Structure
The compressed project folder contains:
- R scripts (`.R`)  
- Datasets (`.csv`) in the file
- README file(`.md`)  
- The main report (`.html`)
- Quarto document (`.qmd`)
- Render-generated files
- Shiny App (`.R`)
- Assignment coversheet
- The project (`.Rproj`)
- A file with an image used in Shiny app

# Data Sources
- UK Police API
- OpenStreetMap (OSM)

Data were collected programmatically using API requests. Due to API rate limits and long runtimes (more than 1 hour), the processed datasets are included in the data/ directory to ensure reproducibility and ease of assessment. However, due to the compressed file size exceeding the 500 MB submission limit, the raw dataset have been removed from the data/ directory. Whereas that also means Quarto document (`.qmd`) cannot be successfully rendered. The report can be viewed directly in the HTML file. If access to the raw data is required, the data can be re-collected by running the provided R scripts that query the API.


# Project Setup and Reproducibility
The project is organised as an RStudio Project (.Rproj), which automatically sets the working directory to the project root. All scripts and the Shiny application use relative file paths. All required R packages are explicitly loaded at the beginning of the scripts.

The R version used for this project is 4.5.1 (2025-06-13).

# How Users Can Reproduce the Analysis

- Download and unzip the project folder.

- Open `Assignment2.Rproj` in RStudio.

- Run the R scripts to reproduce the data processing, and use the included datasets in `data/`.

- To launch the Shiny app, open `app.R` and click the "Run App" button.
